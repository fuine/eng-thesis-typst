= Evaluation
<evaluation>
Evaluation of genome assemblers can be split into two categories:
- Quality
- Performance
I compare _katome_ to three other assemblers, two assemblers chosen by me, as
subjectively leading solutions on the current market:
- Abyss~@simpson2009abyss;
- Velvet~@zerbino2008velvet;
and the assembler _dnaasm_~@dnaasm. Rough size of the original genome for all of the
organisms is given, in both quality and performance evaluations.

== Quality
<quality>
Quality of genome assembly can be assessed by comparing four statistics:

- number of created contigs;

- N50 statistic --- the shortest contig length at 50% of the genome;
- length of the longest contig;
- number of misassemblies
  #block(inset: (left: 1em))[
    The number of misassemblies, using Plantagora's definition. Plantagora defines a
    misassembly breakpoint as a position in the assembled contigs where the left
    flanking sequence aligns over 1 kb away from the right flanking sequence on the
    reference, or they overlap by >1kb, or the flanking sequences align on opposite
    strands or different chromosomes;
  ]
- mismatches per 100 kbp (kilo base pairs)
  #block(inset: (left: 1em))[
    The average number of mismatches per 100 000 aligned bases. (â€¦) This metric does not
    distinguish between single-nucleotide polymorphisms, which are true differences in
    the assembled genome versus the reference genome, and single-nucleotide errors,
    which are due to errors in reads or errors in the assembly algorithm;
  ]
- indels per 100 kbp
  #block(inset: (left: 1em))[
    The average number of single nucleotide insertions or deletions per
    100 000 aligned bases.
  ]

Definitions for No.~of misassemblies, mismatches per 100kbp and indels per 100kbp
after #cite(<gurevich2013quast>, form: "prose");. Generally assemblers strive to achieve
the least number of long contigs. Ideal assembler running on perfect read data should
yield one contig per chromosome, which would represent entire chromosome.

Currently both _katome_ and _dnaasm_ generate contigs and their reverse complement,
meaning that generated data is redundant, as each contig can be found twice --- once in
the coding strand and once in the complementary strand. In the following quality
assessment I will show the number of contigs created by both _katome_ and _dnaasm_ as
divided by two, to fairly compare redundant data.

Evaluation of created contigs has been performed with the 'QUAST' --- quality assessment
tool for genome assemblers~@gurevich2013quast.

Presented results are generated using the following settings for all assemblers:

- k-mer size: $55$;
- reverse complement sequence generation: yes;
- use of paired sequences: no;
- graph correction where possible: yes.

=== Synthetic data generated on the basis of natural data
<synthetic-data-generated-on-the-basis-of-natural-data>
Reads for assemblers have been randomly generated, with uniform distribution (standard
deviation 20), based on the reference genome of the bacteria Escherichia Coli. All reads
are perfect, meaning they don't contain any read errors. The dataset for the bacteria
Escherichia coli is described in the @ecoli_dataset and the results of the quality
evaluation are described in the @qual_coli.

== Performance
<eval:performance>
In this section I present performance results of _katome_, in comparison to other
solutions. Unless stated otherwise size of the k-mer for these evaluations is $55$. Each
cell in the table contains mean time of execution, standard deviation of that time and
peak memory usage of the application. Data that assemblers are tested on is too big to
perfectly measure memory usage (e.g.~via 'valgrind'), and so the memory usage of the
application is probed every 1 millisecond and the peak is reported. While this approach
is not ideal (it can miss the exact peak and report lower usage) in practice this method
turns out to be good enough to estimate the memory usage of the assemblers.

All benchmarks have been performed using the hardware and software listed in the
@smyrna_hw_sw.
